#Trials and Tribulations
No adventure is complete without the bumpy roads along the way. Up until reaching Japan things have gone smoothly. Now however, I'm sitting outside of an airport terminal up waiting for Brian to clear his passport. It's been about 5 hours since we got off of the plane and here we are.

It still doesn't quite feel like we're in Japan yet and it's been about 24 hours since we left home. Although, nothing has really happened and the most exciting thing we've done is beat a record at matching tiles in an airport. Plane rides are usually uneventful, even more so when there's no in-flight entertainment. As I write this another flight from San Francisco (Our departing airport) is arriving here in Haneda. It's 4:24 AM.

Assuming Brian is released sometime soon the rest of the day seems much more enticing and I won't let this bump interfere with my morale quite yet.
